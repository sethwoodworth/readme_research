# has_alter_ego

has_alter_ego makes it possible to keep seed and live data transparently in parallel. In contrast to other seed
data approaches has_alter_ego synchronizes the seed definitions with your database objects automagically unless you've
overridden it in the database.

# Installation

## Rails 2.3.x
### As a gem
Add the following line to your **config/environment.rb** file:
    config.gem "has_alter_ego"
Then
    gem install has_alter_ego
    script/generate has_alter_ego
    rake db:migrate

### As a plugin
    script/plugin install git://github.com/aduffeck/has_alter_ego.git
    script/generate has_alter_ego
    rake db:migrate


## Rails 3
### As a gem
Add the following line to your **Gemfile** file:
    gem "has_alter_ego"
Then
    bundle install
    rails generate has_alter_ego
    rake db:migrate

### As a plugin
    rails plugin install git://github.com/aduffeck/has_alter_ego.git
    rails generate has_alter_ego
    rake db:migrate


# Usage
## General
The seed data is defined in YAML files called after the model's table. The files are expected in **db/fixtures/alter_egos**.

Say you have a Model *Car*. has_alter_ego is enabled with the *has_alter_ego* method:

    create_table :cars do |t|
      t.string :brand
      t.string :model
    end


    class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_alter_ego
    end

You could then create a file **db/fixtures/alter_egos/cars.yml** with the seed data:

    1:
      brand: Lotus
      model: Elise

    2:
      brand: Porsche
      model: 911

    3:
      brand: Ferrari
      model: F50

    4:
      brand: Corvette
      model: C5

and you'd automagically have those objects available in your database.

    Car.find(1)
    => #<Car id: 1, brand: "Lotus", model: "Elise">

Whenever the seed definition changes the objects in the database inherit the changes unless they have been overridden.
When a seed object was destroyed in the database it will not be added again.

**Note:** If the table has a numeric primary key has_alter_ego reserves the first n IDs for seed objects (default=1000),
so the next non-seed object will get the ID 1001.
The number of reserved objects can be set with the optional *:reserved_space* parameter, e.g.

    has_alter_ego :reserved_space => 5000

You always have to make sure that no seed IDs clash with IDs in the database.


## Advanced stuff
You can check if an object was created from seed definition with *has_alter_ego?*:

    @car = Car.find(1)
    @car.has_alter_ego?
    => true

    Car.new.has_alter_ego?
    => false

The method *alter_ego_state* tells whether an object has been overridden. "modified" objects will no longer inherit
changes to the seed data.

    @car.alter_ego_state
    => "default"

    @car.update_attribute(:model, "foo")
    => true
    @car
    => #<Car id: 1, brand: "Lotus", model: "foo">
    @car.alter_ego_state
    => "modified"

If you don't want to inherit changes for an object without actually modifying it you can use *pin!*:

    @car.pin!
    => true
    @car.alter_ego_state
    => "pinned"


*reset* reverts the changes in the database and activates the synchronization again:
    @car.reset
    => #<Car id: 1, brand: "Lotus", model: "Elise">
    @car.alter_ego_state
    => "default"

# Smart associations

It's possible to define dynamic associations in the seed data which is helpful if the IDs of the associated objects are
not known or the associations depends on the state of the objects. This is done by appending *_by* clauses to the
association name, similar to the dynamic finders in ActiveRecord::Base.

**Example:**
db/fixtures/car.yml:
    1:
      brand: Lotus
      model: Elise
      category_id: 3                                   # Static way of specifying associations
      category_by_name: Sport                          # => @car.category = Category.find_by_name("Sport")

      sellers_by_name_and_active: [Hugo, true]         # @car.sellers = Seller.find_all_by_name_and_active("Hugo", true)
      sellers_by_name_and_active: [[Hugo, Egon], true] # @car.sellers = Seller.find_all_by_name_and_active(["Hugo", "Egon"], true)


# Custom logic on seed

has_alter_ego provides a hook for adding custom logic when an object is created or updated from the seed definitions.
Just add a method *on_seed(attributes)* to your Model and you'll have access to all the seed attributes.

**Note:** You should not call save from within the hook or the objects will be marked as modified.

Example:
    class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_alter_ego

      def on_seed(attributes)
        self.price = attributes["price_without_vat"] * VAT_FACTOR
      end
    end

# Generating seed data from the database

has_alter_ego has a rake task for dumping the current database content into a seed file. It is called like this:

    rake has_alter_ego::dump MODEL=Car

That will fill **db/fixtures/alter_egos/cars.yml** with the database objects.
