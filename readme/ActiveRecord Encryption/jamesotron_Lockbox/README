Lockbox
=======

Lockbox is a simple rails plugin that let's you use public key crypto
to encrypt and decrypt strings.
This is just a quick hack, I decided not to go for anything more
elaborate because it met the minimum requirements of what I'm building
and nothing more.
You can always get the latest version of this plugin from Github:
  - http://github.com/jamesotron/Lockbox [web url]
  - git://github.com/jamesotron/Lockbox.git [clone url]

If you're using Lockbox in production please email me and give me your
feedback to james@mashd.cc.  Feel free to fork Lockbox on github and
or send me patches, I'm always interested in use cases.

Lockbox is released under the Mozilla MPL 1.1, all code is copyright
2009 James Harton.

Example
=======

Use openssl to generate the keys:

# openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
..................................................................................................................+++
..........+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for private.pem:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for private.pem:
# openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout
Enter pass phrase for private.pem:
writing RSA key

Next, move the private and public key files into $RAILS_ROOT/config/ and
configure Lockbox:

mv public.pem private.pem config/
cat <<EOF > config/lockbox.yml
development:
  public_key_path: config/public.pem
  private_key_path: config/private.pem

testing:
  public_key_path: vendor/plugins/lockbox/test/public.pem
  private_key_path: vendor/plugins/lockbox/test/private.pem
  pass_phrase: test

production:
  public_key_path: config/public.pem
  private_key_path: config/private.pem
EOF

You might wish to stop your Rails application from running, and display
a passphrase entry dialogue if the Lockbox hasn't been unlocked:

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

  before_filter :unlock_box

  def unlock_box
    if Lockbox.locked?
      redirect_to :controller => 'unlock', :action => 'prompt'
    end
  end

end

You can use lockbox in your model by using the acts_as_lockbox class
method:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  acts_as_lockbox :for => [ :password, :credit_card_number ]

end
