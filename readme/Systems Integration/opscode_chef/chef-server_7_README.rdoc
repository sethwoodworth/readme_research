= Chef Server

== Description
Chef Server is a meta package. It only exists to depend on the other packages needed to run a chef server, so they may be installed and upgraded more easily:
* chef-server-api: The primary chef server, clients and the webui interact with it via a JSON REST API.
* chef-server-webui: Web (HTML and javascript) interface to the chef-server-api
* chef-solr: A wrapper to the Solr full text indexer
* chef-solr-indexer: Listens to rabbitmq for updates to indexed data (sent by chef-server-api), and denormalizes data for searchability.
