# This is your AutomateIt project's "lib" directory. You can put custom plugins
# and convenience methods into this directory. For example, you'd put your
# custom PackageManager plugin here or a file that contains a method definition
# for a command you want to use frequently.
#
# These files are loaded every time an AutomateIt interpreter is created. It'll
# load all the "*.rb" files in this directory, and all the "init.rb" files in
# subdirectories within this directory. Because these files are loaded each
# time an interpreter is started, you should try to make sure these contents
# are loaded quickly and don't cause unintended side-effects.
