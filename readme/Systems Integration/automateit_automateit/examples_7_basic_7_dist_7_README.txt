# This is your AutomateIt project's "dist" directory. You should keep files and
# templates that you wish to distribute into this directory. You can access
# this path using the "dist" keyword in your recipes, for example:
#
#     # Render the template file "dist/foo.erb"
#     render(:file => dist+"/foo.erb", ...)
#
#     # Or copy the same file
#     cp(dist+"/foo.erb", ...)
