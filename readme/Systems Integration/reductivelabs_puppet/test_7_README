To run all tests, run: 'rake test'.  To run an individual suite, run the file
directly.  e.g. cd test/util; ./utiltest.rb

You might need to run some tests as root.

If you do not have rake installed:
  gem install rake

## The following information is possibly out of date?

Tests are organized into a dual hierarchy: each subdirectory is
considered a test suite, and each file in the subdirectory is considered
a test case.  You can use any test case as an example of how to write
more of them, but basically the only requirements are that they each have
their own class names, their names each match /tc_.+\.r/, and that they have
the following header:

if __FILE__ == $0
    $:.unshift '..'
    $:.unshift '../../lib'
    $blinkbase = "../.."
end
