Monitors for slow MongoDB queries and generates an alert (containing the queries) whey they occur.

The plugin has two options, the database and a threshold for slow query times

It automatically sets the profiling level of the named database to slow_queries only or above.

Dependencies: the mongo and mongo_ext gems (gem install mongo; gem install mongo_ext).
IMPORTANT: The minimum version for both gems is 0.18.3.
