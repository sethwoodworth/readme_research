Amazon S3 Plugin
==================================

Created by [Koordinates](http://koordinates.com)

Reports on Amazon S3 usage for a particular set of buckets.

You want to increase your reporting interval to something >0 so the AWS 
reporting service doesn't get hammered with no real reason (data is hourly).

Dependencies
------------

  Python! Ha. Take that!

  You need to put check_aws_usage.py somewhere on your system, and specify
  the path in the `script_path` option. 
  
  It requires [Mechanize](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/), 
  which is packaged in Debian/Ubuntu (python-mechanize) or installable
  via `easy_install mechanize` elsewhere.

Compatibility
-------------

Tested on Linux
