Summary
------------

This plugin will monitor a directory of mongrel_cluster configuration files and attempt to run the "status" command using:

mongrel_rails cluster::status -C application.yml

If it finds a down mongrel (a search for the word "missing"), it will send an Alert.  On the subsequent run, if the mongrel is still down, it will attempt a "start" using:

mongrel_rails cluster::start -C application.yml

On the next subsequent run, if the mongrel is still down, it will continue to send Alerts, and repeat the process.

Dependencies
------------

Requires mongrel and mongrel_cluster [mongrel](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/):

	sudo gem install mongrel mongrel_cluster
	
Options
-------

Mongrel Configuration Directory.  This is usually /etc/mongrel_cluster, the path that stores application .yml files for mongrel's cluster startup options.

Compatibility 
-------------

Works on Linux and OSX.
