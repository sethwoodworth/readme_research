Monitors for slow MySQL queries and generates an alert (containing the queries) whey they occur.

The plugin has two options, the path to your MySQL slow queries log and the threshold for a very slow query.

You must enable the [MySQL slow queries log](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/slow-query-log.html) in your my.cnf file.

This can be done with the following 2 lines:

set-variable=long_query_time=2
log-slow-queries=/var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
