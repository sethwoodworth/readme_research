Lighthouse Open Tickets Plugin
=================================
Created by [David Grandinetti](http://github.com/dbgrandi)

Returns the total number of open tickets for a specific project in a Lighthouse account.

Dependencies
------------
Requires an account at [Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com).

Requires the [lighthouse-api gem](http://github.com/Caged/lighthouse-api/tree/master):

	gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
	sudo gem install Caged-lighthouse-api
	
Usage Notes
-----------

The project id can be found in the URL for your project. It is *just* the number part of the url, not
the project name abbreviation.

The account name should just be your sub-domain, not the whole myproject.lighthouseapp.com.

Compatibility 
-------------

Works on Linux and OSX.
