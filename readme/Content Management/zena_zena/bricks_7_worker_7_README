== Presentation

Provides delayed jobs: long running tasks can be processed offline,
without halting the visitor's browser. If you enable sphinx, this is
a must-have once your site grows bigger and you have lots of deltas
between index rebuilds.

== Install

Drop the folder into the "bricks" folder and install the delayed_job gem:

# install delayed_job gem:
> sudo gem install delayed_job

# if you want to use this with sphinx you also need
> sudo gem install ts-delayed-delta

# enable brick in config/bricks.yml
