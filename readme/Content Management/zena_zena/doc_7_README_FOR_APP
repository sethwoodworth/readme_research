== Presentation

Zena is a content management system. It lets you manage, share and write information.

=== Design

One of the strong design ideas in zena was to use class inheritance to reflect the type of data managed. Please look at Node to view the actual class inheritance diagram.

=== Templating

Please look at zafu[http://zenadmin.org/en/documentation/page24.html] until we finish writing this section.

=== general info
* when creating the database: "create database zena DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_general_ci;"
