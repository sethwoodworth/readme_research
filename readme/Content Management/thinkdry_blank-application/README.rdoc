= BLANK APPLICATION - Multimedia Content Management Framework.
 
==== Author: ThinkDRY

==== Version: 1.0.4

==== Date: December 15th 2009

===OVERVIEW

The BLANK Application is a collaborative Content Management Framework which allows users to store and share various type of contents (articles, videos, files, pictures, RSS Feed). Content is organized in workspaces with rights applied on them. A configuration page allows superadministrator to custom content types, rights, filters, translations and other common stuff (Logo, name, exception mail). 

We call it Framework rather than System cause BlankApplication is a developer oriented application and it's build to simplify your work guys. 
That's how we create in thinkDRY live applications in days.

The application is RESTful, use Test-Driven and Behaviour-Driven development and try to include few good practices : 
- RDOC
- RSPEC
- Use of engines 
- DRY & Commented code

As good Rails stuffs always came from space, we are connected to them and widely used their special combos:
- Acts_as_xapian
- Searchlogic
- Delayed-job
- Paperclip
- Make ressourcefull
- PaulDix-FeedZirra
- Faker
- Populator
- and much more

This is a live a application with daily commits on http:/forge.thinkdry.com. Public GitHub version is as stable as possible. 
BlankApplication is currently live: 
- www.theatre-lacriee.com
- www.culturepub.fr
- www.netic-agency.fr
and is comming on www.tarifmedia.com, http://reflex-culture.thinkdry.com.

We have a heavy bag of ideas and are still open to get more. Believe us something is happening here.
