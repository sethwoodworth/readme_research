h1. About Typo

Being around since March 2005, Typo is (probably) the oldest blogging platform in Rails. It has a full set of feature you would expect from such an engine, powerful SEO capabilities and full themes and plugin
extension. It is available as a gem or source tarball.

Current version is Typo 5.5 for Ruby on Rails 2.3.8.

h1. Installing Typo

There are various way of installing Typo, but the easiest way is certainly using our gem.

h2. 1. Prerequisites

To install Typo you need the following:

* Ruby 1.8.7 or Ruby Enterprise Edition
* Ruby On Rails 2.3.8
* A database engine, MySQL, PgSQL or SQLite3
* The Ruby connector to your favourite database engine

h2. 2. Install the gem

If you have root access, just run:

<pre>
  $ sudo gem install typo
</pre>

Otherwise:

<pre>
  $ export GEM_PATH=~/gems
  $ gem install -i ~/gems typo
</pre>

h2. 3. Install Typo

Typo comes as a highly configurable binary installer. By default, it runs with Mongrel on a random port between 4000 and 5000 and SQLite3. However we recommend using a more production ready database engine and a faster, more scalable web server. MySQL and Passenger running either on Apache or Nginx are our favourite options.

To install Typo with the default options, just run:

<pre>
  typo install /some/path
</pre>

This will install typo with SQLite3 and will spawn it to some random port.

To chose your database engine and web server, run the following:

<pre>
  typo install /some/path web-server=my_server database=my_db db_password=password db_user=my_app db_name=my_app some/path
</pre>

Options for _web-server_ are:

* mongrel
* mongrel_cluster
* external: Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd... with Fastcgi, mod_rails, Thin...

For more information about installing Typo from the gem, please read "our installer documentation":http://github.com/fdv/typo/raw/master/doc/Installer.txt

h2. 4. Start / stop Typo

If you're using _mongrel_ or _mongrel_cluster_ you'll be able to start / stop your Typo engine using Typo binary:

<pre>
  $ typo start some/path
</pre>

<pre>
  $ typo stop some/path
</pre>

h1. Daily use
