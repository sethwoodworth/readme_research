Ansuz is an open source Content Management System built in Ruby on Rails.
It aims for a modular / plugin-based design, and should have more features
out of the box than any other Rails CMS weâ€™re aware of.
 
By combining the CMSes of Isshen Solutions and Isotope 11, we plan to create
a best-of-breed technology suitable for production use on a myriad of sites.
Ansuz is licensed via the BSD license.
 
## Quick Start
 
 1. clone from github: git clone git://github.com/knewter/ansuz.git
 2. install gems: sudo rake gems:install
 3. create proper config/database.yml (note: install script supports this, but db script creation is bugged, so should be done externally from the script)
 3. create databases for development & test environments (note: install script is currently bugged for this)
 4. rake ansuz:install
 
NOTE: SQLite has problems with ansuz, please don't use it for now.

NOTE: See the [Ansuz Site Launcher](http://github.com/knewter/ansuz_launcher/tree/master)

If run with sudo on a server with passenger set up and all the gems already installed, 
it will check out a new ansuz and set up a fresh database for it and set up a vhost 
for the domain specified. So, then if that domain points to the server, Bam! Done.
