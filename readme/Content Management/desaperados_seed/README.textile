h2. Quick Start

<pre><code>
git clone git://github.com/desaperados/seed.git seed
cd seed
script/setup demo
script/server

Load http://localhost:3000 in your browser
</pre></code>

h2. Customising

All customisation is handled inside vendor/plugins/yourappname_engine

To override the default stylesheet create a file named default.css
in vendor/plugins/yourappname_engine/public/stylesheets/default.css

Additional stylesheets in this directory will be automatically detected
and included in the document head.

You can override default views by replicating the main seed view directory 
in yourappname_engine/app/views. For example to override the default articles
index:

<pre>
seed
  /app
    /views
      /articles
        index.html.erb
</pre>
        
Create your own index.html.erb here:

<pre>
seed
  /vendor
    /plugins
      /yourappname_engine
        /app
          /articles
            index.html.erb
</pre>
