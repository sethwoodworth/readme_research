== DESCRIPTION

Crate is a developer tool to help package up your application as a custom static
build of the ruby interpreter plus all dependent binary extensions.  All the
pure ruby code (the ruby application, the ruby stdlib, etc ) is packed into one
or more SQLite databases.

The final distributable pieces are a single executable and a few SQLite
databases which can be then wrapped up appropriately as an OS X App; a self
extracting executable for Windows; a shar archive, rpm or tarball for Unixes.

== INSTALL

gem install crate
