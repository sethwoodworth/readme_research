= MIDIator

A nice Ruby interface to your system's MIDI services.

== General Information

MIDIator was inspired by Topher Cyll's fantastic Practical Ruby Projects book.
In it, Topher describes how to interact with the MIDI providers in OSX, Linux,
and Windows.  As I was reading the book, I noticed some things I would do
differently, which got me thinking that maybe it would be valuable to package
up my modifications to the book's code and release it as a gem.

== Features

* Cross-platform system for MIDI output
* Built-in softsynth (OS X only, so far)

== Credits

Huge, huge credit goes to Topher Cyll, without whom I would have had to figure
all of this crap out for myself.  Apress also deserves some credit; they
released all the source in their book under the MIT license.  That's a big
deal and you should buy their books.

Props also go to the folks who have contributed patches.  In alphabetical
order:
