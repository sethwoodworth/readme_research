Can Flag
=================
Strongly inspired by acts_as_flaggable.
Intended to allow your users to flag content as inappropriate, and set up some ways for you 
to deal with the content.

== Resources

Install

1. Download the tarball from github, or, clone the repository and symlink it into your application.
   Yes, I'm serious.
  
2. $ script/generate can_flag flags

   This will create the following files:
     app/controllers/flags_controller.rb
     spec/helpers/flags_controller_spec.rb
     app/helpers/flags_helper
     db/migrate/flags_migration.rb

3. Modify any content model with
  
   class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
     can_be_flagged
   end
   
   You can also add a callback
   
   class Article
     can_be_flagged
     def after_flagged
       # send an email
       # delete this post
       # suspend the owner of the post if the flags.size > 3
       # suspend the owner of the post if their total flags count > 5
     end
   end

4. Modify your user model with
 
   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
     can_flag     
   end

5. Usage

   article = Article.find(4)
   current_user.flags.create :flaggable => article

 

 * When a flag is added via add_flag, flagged(flag, flag_count) is called
   on the flaggable model.  This allows the model to perform certain
   operations if the number of flags reaches a certain point.  For example,
   you may want to mark a Post as deleted if a Post receives too many "spam"
   flags
 
 * Each flag reference flaggable object
 
 model = Model.find(1)
 model.flags.get(0).commtable == model
