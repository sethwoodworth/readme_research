Sweeper Generator
=================

Usage:

  ./script/generate sweeper SweeperName callback1 callback2

Description:

	The sweeper generator creates stubs for a new sweeper.

	The generator takes one sweeper name and a list of sweeper 
	methods as arguments. The sweeper name will be used as 
	the initial observer, but you can change that after it
	has been generated.

	The sweeper name may be given in CamelCase or under_score 
	and should NOT be suffixed with 'Sweeper'. 

	The generator creates a sweeper class in app/models.
	
Example:

	./script/generate sweeper Vote after_save before_destroy

	Sweeper: app/models/vote_sweeper.rb	  

	class VoteSweeper < ActionController::Caching::Sweeper

		observe Vote

		def after_save(record)
		end
	  
		def after_update(record)
		end
	  
	end
