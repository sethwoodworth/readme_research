= New Gem Generator

* http://newgem.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION:

Quickly bundle any Ruby libraries into a RubyGem and share it with the world, your colleagues, or perhaps just with yourself amongst your projects.

RubyGems are centrally stored, versioned, and support dependencies between other gems, so they are the ultimate way to bundle libraries, executables, associated tests, examples, and more.

Within this gem, you get one thing - <code>newgem</code> - an executable to create your own gems. Your new gems will include designated folders for Ruby code, test files, executables, and even a default website page for you to explain your project, and which instantly uploads to RubyForge website (which looks just like this one by default)
  
== BASIC USAGE:

Go to the folder where you want to create your new gem folder structure, and run the <code>newgem</code> command to generate your gem scaffolding.

  cd ~/ruby_projects
  $ newgem wizzo
          create  
          create  doc
          create  lib
          create  script

          create  Rakefile
          create  README.rdoc

      dependency  install_rubigen_scripts
          exists    script
          create    script/generate
          create    script/destroy

    Important
    =========

    * Open Rakefile
    * Update missing details (gem description, dependent gems, etc.)

You can generate test::unit or rspec test stubs via the -T, --test-with options (shoulda coming soon)

== SYNOPSIS:

Now modify the constants at the top of *config/hoe.rb*, with your name, email and the location where you'll host your website for the gem. The defaults are tied to RubyForge for uploading the gems and the website.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* hoe
* rubyforge

== INSTALL:

The <code>newgem</code> application is distributed itself as a RubyGem and is available immediately after installation.

  sudo gem install newgem

Alternately, download the gem and install manually.

== TICKETS:

Tickets or suggestions can be raised at http://drnic.lighthouseapp.com/projects/18881-newgem/overview

== DOES IT WORK?

Much of newgem's behaviour is covered by functional tests (see features at http://github.com/drnic/newgem/tree/master/features).

With each commit to the master branch of the git repository, these functional tests and the unit tests are run via a continuous integration server.
