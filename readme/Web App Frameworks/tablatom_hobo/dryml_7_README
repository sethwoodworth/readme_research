# DRYML

DRYML is the Don't Repeat Yourself Markup Language.  It uses an
XML-like syntax and is best at creating XHTML documents.  It could be
used to create other forms of plain-text documents, but the syntax is
not optimized for that and you may end up with extra carriage returns.
(Which would be a bug, so please send test cases).

DRYML was created for the Hobo project, but this is an extraction from
that project and can be used separately.

# How to use with Rails but without Hobo

- install both HoboSupport and Dryml as a plugin or gem

- create an `application.dryml`

    $ mkdir app/views/taglibs
    $ touch app/views/taglibs/application.dryml

- create `config/initializers/dryml.rb`

    require 'dryml'
    require 'dryml/template'
    require 'dryml/dryml_generator'
    Dryml.enable

Now you can use templates that end in ".dryml".  Such templates will
ignore layouts.

# How to use outside of Rails

    Dryml.render("<html><%= this %></html>", {:this => something})

See the [rdoc](http://fixme/doc/Dryml.html#render-instance_method) for
more information.
