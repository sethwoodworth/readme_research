~~~(^._.^)~~~ Bats!

A micro-framework.

Bats! implements an easy to use router on top of Rack for handling REST
requests.  This makes getting an app up and running ridiculously easy.

Bats! stays out of your way.  It doesn't ask you to use any particular
development methodology, templating framework, or other such tom-foolery.

Example usage:

# config.ru

require 'bats'

class App < Bats
	get '/' do
		s( 200 ).b 'Flap flap flap'
	end
end

run App
