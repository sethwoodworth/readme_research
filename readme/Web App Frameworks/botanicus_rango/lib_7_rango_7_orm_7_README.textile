h1. Kinds of Support

h2. Core Support

- Tasks for migrations, creating db etc

h2. Extended Support

- Custom fields (SlugField, ImageField etc)
- Whatever else

h1. Why not ...

h2. Save Used ORM in Project.orm or somewhere?

Because if you need have aditional support for each ORM, it's part of setup to put @load "myplugin/tasks/datamapper.rake"@ to user's Rakefile etc, so there is no need for this.

h2. Support @config/database.yml@

Because it has no point. You can use API of your ORM directly.

h2. Define @form_for@

It's job of your helpers.
