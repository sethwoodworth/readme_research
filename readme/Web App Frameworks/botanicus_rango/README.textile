h1. Installation via RubyGems

* Daily builds: @gem install rango --pre@ and @gem install simple-templater@. RubyGems don't work with prerelease gems properly, so you can't just run @gem install simple-templater rango --pre@. The trouble is when you are installing with @--pre@, RubyGems are looking just for prerelease gems, but Erubis, which is dependency of simple-templater, doesn't have any prerelease gem.
* Stable version: @gem install simple-templater rango@
* JRuby: @jruby --1.9 -S gem install simple-templater rango@ is how you should install Rango for JRuby. Unfortunately I'm getting strange errors here. Don't forget the @--1.9@ argument, because Rango can be installed just on Ruby 1.9.

_Rango itself doesn't define any runtime dependencies, since you may want to use just a subset of Rango, i. e. just template layer. If you are using stack generator, you get @Gemfile@ with usual dependencies, so @gem bundle@ will take care about it._

h1. Installation via "Rip":http://hellorip.com

* Install edge version: @rip install git://github.com/botanicus/rango.git@
* Install tagged version: @rip install git://github.com/botanicus/rango.git 0.2@

h1. How to Contribute To Rango

Contributions to Rango is easy, you don't have to create a ticket or something, the only thing you really have to do is write good code. Before you send a pull request, please ensure that you:
* Have no trailing whitespace in your code (if you run @rake hooks@, you get git pre-commit hook which take care about it)
* Wrote YARD documentation
* Wrote specs and run them under at least under Ruby 1.9.1, ideally under all the supported Ruby platforms:

<pre>
# run all the specs under Ruby 1.9.1 and Ruby 1.9.2
rvm specs 1.9.1,1.9.2

# run given spec under all installed Ruby implementations
rvm ruby ./script/spec spec/rango/mixins/message_spec.rb

# run given spec under Ruby 1.9.1
rvm 1.9.1 ruby ./script/spec spec/rango/mixins/message_spec.rb
</pre>
