DB2S3 - A rails plugin to backup Mysql to Amazon S3
---------------------------------------------------
You're looking at a monthly spend of four cents
So pony up you cheap bastard, and store your backups on S3

Usage:
  # In config/environment.rb
  config.gem "db2s3", :source => "http://gemcutter.org"

  # In Rakefile
  require 'db2s3/tasks'

  # In config/initializers/db2s3.rb
  DB2S3::Config.instance_eval do
    S3 = {
      :access_key_id     => 'yourkey',
      :secret_access_key => 'yoursecretkey',
      :bucket            => 'yourapp-db-backup'
    }
  end
  # DB credentials are read from your rails environment

  rake gems:install

  # Add to your crontab or whatever
  rake db2s3:backup:full
  rake db2s3:backup:incremental # Unimplemented

  # Handy tasks
  rake db2s3:statistics      # Shows you the size of your DB
  rake db2s3:backup:restore  # You should be testing this regularly
  rake db2s3:backup:clean    # Clean up old backups - cron this
