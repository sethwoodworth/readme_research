# DynamicMatic

DynamicMatic is a tiny [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) extension
that integrates Sinatra with [StaticMatic](http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org).
It allows most of your site to be static
while having a few dynamic pages that can use the StaticMatic layouts and partials.

## Setup

Your Sinatra and StaticMatic apps live side-by-side.
The StaticMatic `site` directory is used as the directory for Sinatra's public files,
and the `src` directory contains the source for the static pages
and the layouts that are shared between StaticMatic and Sinatra.
Otherwise the standard Sinatra directories are used.

If the Sinatra `:root` option is changed,
DynamicMatic will respect that and set the StaticMatic paths appropriately.

## Usage

If you're using a classic-style Sinatra application,
all you have to do is `require 'sinatra/dynamicmatic'`.
If you're using a modular application,
you'll also have to `include Sinatra::DynamicMatic`
in your `Sinatra::Base` subclass.

## How it Works

The static pages and stylesheets in the StaticMatic `src` directory
are served statically - they should be compiled before the server is started.
This can be done using `staticmatic.run("build")` in your Sinatra app.

Any dynamic Sinatra pages can make use of the StaticMatic layouts and helpers,
but are rendered dynamically on each request.

## Layouts

StaticMatic layouts are made available as normal Sinatra templates.
For example, if you have `src/layouts/application.haml` and `src/layouts/help.haml`,
`application.haml` will be used as the `:application` template,
and `help.haml` will be used as the `:help` template.
`application.haml` will *also* be used for the default layout for Sinatra pages.

## Helpers

All the StaticMatic helpers, including those for partial-rendering,
are available in Sinatra views.
The reverse is not true;
Sinatra helpers are generally not available for StaticMatic pages,
since they are rendered statically.

Sinatra helpers are, however, available for StaticMatic layouts
**but only when they're being used for dynamic views**.
It's not safe to rely on them being there,
although you can check for their existence with `defined?`
and call them if they're there.

## Configuration

StaticMatic is configured using `src/configuration.rb`.
Sinatra is configured using the `set` method.
In other words, configuration happens as usual.

## Preview

When you run your app in development mode,
your static pages are actually generated dynamically on each request,
just like with `staticmatic preview`.
Once you're in production, though,
they're all served swiftly from the `site` folder.
