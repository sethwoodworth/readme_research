DocBox sits on top of RDoc and allows users to update documentation through a wiki-like interface. Its main purpose is to make the bar much lower for updating of documentation, a task which someone without technical knowledge should be able to do. One requirement for DocBox is that it still gives people credit for there work, especially those who update documentation. It is written using the Ruby on Rails framework, and it  makes use of either Git or SVN version control systems.
