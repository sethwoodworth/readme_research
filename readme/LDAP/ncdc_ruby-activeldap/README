== DESCRIPTION

'ActiveLdap' is a ruby extension library which provides a clean objected
oriented interface to the Ruby/LDAP[0] library.  It was inspired by
ActivRecord[3]. This is not nearly as clean or as flexible as ActiveRecord, but
it is still trivial to define new objects and manipulate them with minimal
difficulty.

For example and usage - read the rdoc in doc/ from lib/activeldap.rb.
It is also available on the web at:

http://ruby-activeldap.rubyforge.org/

== PREREQUISITES

[Ruby intepreter]
  One of them:
  * Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org] (1.8.x or 1.9.1)
  * JRuby[http://jruby.codehaus.org/]

[LDAP client]
  JRuby doesn't need to install new library because JRuby
  has builtin LDAP support. Ruby users need one of them:
  * Ruby/LDAP[http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-ldap/]
  * Net::LDAP[http://rubyforge.org/projects/net-ldap/]

* ActiveRecord[http://activerecord.rubyonrails.org]

== NOTES

* Only GSSAPI SASL support exists due to Ruby/LDAP limitations

== INSTALL

  % sudo gem install activeldap

== RAILS

There is a small rails plugin included that allows the use
of a file named 'config/ldap.yml' in the config directory of
your rails app. This file has a similar function to the
'database.yml' file that allows you to set your database
connection settings per environment. Similarly, the ldap.yml
file allows settings to be set for development, test, and
production environments. For instance, the development entry
would look something like the following:

  development:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 389
    base: dc=localhost
    bind_dn: cn=admin,dc=localhost
    password: secret

To install, simply add the following codes to you config/environment.rb:

  config.gem "activeldap", :lib => "active_ldap"

When your application starts up, the plugin will call
ActiveLdap::Base.setup_connection using the parameters
specified for your current environment.
