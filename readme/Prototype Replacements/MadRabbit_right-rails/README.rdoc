= Welcome To RightRails

RightRails is a RubyOnRails plugin for {RightJS}[http://rightjs.org] javascript framework.

It works as a drop in replacement for all the Prototype/Scriptaculous
methods, plus it brings some more sweets and routine ajax operation
helpers.


== Features

* Lightning fast RightJS library
* Transparent Prototype/Scriptaculous helpers replacement
* More powerful and flexible new JavaScript generator for RJS
* Conventional JavaScript interface for the most common AJAX operations
* Better controller level access to the rjs generator
* New ajax-friendly scaffold generator
* Remote files uploading organization
* Automatic RightJS modules inclusion handling (including i18n modules)
* Additional FormBuilder methods for various fields
* Underscored and ruby-like aliases for RightJS core methods


== Installation

RightRails is available as a normal ruby-gem

    sudo gem install right-rails

Or you can install it as a rails plugin

In case of ruby-gem and Rails 3, add the following into your +Gemfile+
