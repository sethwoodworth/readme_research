# slidedown

Generate HTML slides with Markdown.

*Spoiler Alert: It doesn't work so well with Internet Explorer. Other browsers should be fine.*

## Usage

Write your talk.

    !SLIDE
    
    # This is my talk
    
    !SLIDE
    
    ## I hope you enjoy it
    
    !SLIDE code
    
        def foo
          :bar
        end
    
    !SLIDE
    
    Google is [here](http://google.com)

    # Questions?

Generate the output:

    $ slidedown my-talk.md

### Custom Styles

To add custom styles to your slides, just create stylesheets in the same directory as your presentation markdown file:

    | - presentation-directory
      | - slides.md
      | - styles.css

The additional styles will be added to your generated slides.

## Navigation

Give your presentation!

* left, right arrows to navigate through slides
* esc to go home

## Syntax Highlighting

For Ruby:

    @@@ ruby
        def foo
          :bar
        end
    @@@

For Javascript

    @@@ js
        function foo() {
          return 'bar';
        }
    @@@

For ERb:

    @@@ rhtml
        <%= @post.created_at.to_s(:fancy) %>
    @@@

### Requirements

* Nokogiri
* makers-mark
* pygments (for syntax highlighting)

## Todo

* Other means of navigation besides left/right keys
* Vertical view of all slides in a row
* Generate PDFs (maybe via cucumber)
* Stop making Nokogiri sad when parsing out snippets
